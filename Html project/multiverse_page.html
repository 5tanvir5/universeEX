        The <strong><mark>Multiverse</mark></strong>  is a hypothetical group of multiple universes.[a] Together,
         these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information,
          and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are 
          called
           "parallel universes", "other universes", "alternate universes", or "many worlds" <br><br><br>

           <strong style="font-size: 130%;">Multiverse Theory:-</strong><br>
           A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within string theory and its higher-dimensional extension, M-theory.[62]

These theories require the presence of 10 or 11 spacetime dimensions respectively. The extra six or seven dimensions may either be compactified
 on a very small scale, or our universe may simply be localized on a dynamical (3+1)-dimensional object, a D3-brane. This opens up the possibility
  that there are other branes which could support other universes.[6 <br><br><br>

  <strong style="font-size: 130%;">History of the concept:-</strong> 
  Early recorded examples of the idea of infinite worlds existed in the philosophy of Ancient Greek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism">Atomism</a>, which proposed that infinite parallel 
  worlds arose from the collision of atoms. In the third century BCE, the philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus" >Chrysippus </a>suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated,
   effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time.[1] The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</a>

The American philosopher and psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James" >William James</a> used the term "multiverse" in 1895, but in a different context.[2]

In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin">Dublin</a> in 1952, Erwin Schr√∂dinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He said
 that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously".[3] This sort
  of duality is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">"superposition"</a>.

The term was first used in fiction and in its current physics context by Michael Moorcock in his 1963 SF Adventures novella The Sundered Worlds (part
 of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Champion"> Eternal Champion</a> series). (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_(Michael_Moorcock)">Multiverse (Michael Moorcock</a>)
